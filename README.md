Anime Voting web app created using C# ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend, saving the data inside of a PostgreSQL database.
This web app allows the user to see a pair of random characters, then the user can vote for it's favorite character out of the two, and immediately another pair will appear.
The top 10 voted characters can be seen on a leaderboard, so it incentivizes users to engage with the app and vote for their favorite characters/shows when they appear.
The admin can see the stats of the app, like the total amount of users, amount of characters and total amount of votes that have been casted.
The following Youtube video is a demo of the app:

This app is not currently being hosted in a website, due to lacking financial resources.
